# Oudioo player
Building an audio player with integrated ad functionality can be an involved process but can provide a unique feature for your users. Here are some steps to consider when planning this feature:

## Future Features for  Oudioo
### Ad Configuration: 
Provide a way for your users to configure ads. This could be a form where users specify the ad's audio URL, the time during the podcast the ad should play (either a specific timestamp or intervals), and perhaps an option for how often the ad should repeat.

### Store Ad Configuration: 
Save this configuration to a database associated with the specific podcast episode. This could be a separate table or collection in your database that links ads to their respective episodes.

### Ad Retrieval: 
When the specific podcast episode is fetched to be played, also retrieve the ad configuration for that episode. You might need to make modifications to your API to ensure the ad configuration is sent along with the podcast episode data.

### Audio Player Modifications: 
Modify the audio player to include functionality for playing ads. This could involve setting up event listeners on the audio player's timeupdate event, which fires when the current playback position changed. When the event fires, check if the current playback time matches any of the configured ad times.

### Playing the Ad: 
If the playback time matches an ad time, pause the podcast, switch the audio source to the ad's audio URL, and play the ad. This will require controlling the audio player's src attribute and using the play and pause methods.

### Post-Ad Behavior: 
After the ad finishes playing (which you can detect with the ended event), switch the audio source back to the podcast, seek to the position where the podcast was paused (using the currentTime attribute), and resume playing the podcast.

### UI Indication: 
Consider adding visual indications in the player's progress bar to show when ads will play. This can be a useful feature for users.
Remember that changing audio sources can lead to small delays due to network latency, which might disrupt the user's listening experience. If this becomes a problem, you might want to look into more advanced techniques, like preloading ad audio or using the Web Audio API for more seamless transitions.
